Radical Dreamers is a Japanese video game produced by Square (now Square Enix) in 1996 for the Nintendo Super Famicom's Satellaview add-on. It is a text-based visual novel in which the player takes the role of Serge, a young adventurer accompanied by Kid, a teen-aged thief, and Gil, a masked magician. The game is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger in the Chrono series, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross. It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers was not designed to lock after a certain number of play-throughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play
